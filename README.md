# Productivity Score Prediction

This project predicts a **Productivity Score** based on daily lifestyle and activity factors using **Machine Learning**.

The model takes user inputs such as **Work Hours, Exercise Time, Sleep Hours, and Screen Time**, and outputs a productivity score that reflects overall daily efficiency and health balance.

## Dataset Description

The dataset contains the following features:

| Feature | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Work Hours | Daily working time |
| Exercise Time | Time spent exercising |
| Sleep Hours | Daily sleep duration |
| Screen Time | Screen usage time |
| Productivity Score | Target variable |

##  Example Use Cases

- Track personal productivity
- Analyze lifestyle impact on performance
- Beginner ML regression practice
- Academic mini-project
- Portfolio project

---

##  Limitations

- Uses a small dataset (not real-world scale)
- Assumes linear relationships between features
- Productivity score is an estimation, not medical or psychological advice
- No real-time data collection
- Model accuracy depends on dataset quality

---

##  Future Improvements

- Add larger real-world dataset  
- Deploy using Streamlit or Flask  
- Add feature importance visualization  
- Improve model using advanced algorithms  
- Collect real-time user data
